# üöÄ **FinPulse: Stock Sentiment-Aware Price Forecasting + MLStack**

A production-grade hybrid ML system that combines market data with real-time financial sentiment (from news, Twitter, etc.) to predict short-term stock price movements. Designed and deployed with full **MLOps** automation on Chameleon Cloud, **FinPulse** targets **quantitative hedge funds** and **alt-data research teams** seeking operational efficiency and faster signal-to-trade pipelines.

---

## üîç Value Proposition

**üéØ Target Customer:**  
Quantitative research teams at hedge funds like Two Sigma, Citadel, or Bloomberg and personal investors.

**üìä Status Quo:**  
These teams rely on fragmented workflows: NLP-based sentiment research, price modeling, and deployment are siloed. Retraining is ad hoc, and monitoring is minimal.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Our Solution:

**FinPulse** automates the full ML lifecycle:

- üì∞ Real-time ingestion of financial data (Twitter + Vantage)
- üí¨ Sentiment extraction using **FinBERT**
- üìâ Price prediction via **LSTM**
- ‚öôÔ∏è Serving via **FastAPI**
- üìà Monitoring via **Prometheus + Grafana**
- üîÅ Retraining pipeline with **Ray + MLflow**

---

### üìê Business Metric Impact:

- ‚úÖ **Accuracy:** MAE, MAPE for classification metrics for sentiment  
- ‚ö° **Inference Latency:** Tracked for CPU  
- üß† **Model Freshness:** Ensured via scheduled retraining and drift detection

## 1. üöÄ Continuous X & DevOps
 
### CI/CD Workflow

Our aim is to deploy an end-to-end **MLOps** infrastructure and workflow automation system on the Chameleon Cloud testbed. The goal was to support continuous training, containerization, and deployment of a custom LSTM model for stock price prediction. The implementation combined Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**) practices with Continuous X (training, building, deployment, and promotion) workflows using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Argo Workflows**, **ArgoCD**, **MLflow**, and **MinIO**.

---

## Section 1: Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**)

### üõ† Work Executed

We provisioned a full-featured **MLOps** infrastructure on Chameleon Cloud using Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**) principles.

This included:

- A 3-node Kubernetes cluster using **Terraform**
- Automated configuration and deployment using **Ansible**
- Installation of core services such as **ArgoCD**, **Argo Workflows**, **MLflow**, **MinIO**, and **PostgreSQL**

### Implementation Approach and Methodology -

#### Keypair and Project Setup via [Trovi JupyterLab](https://jupyter.chameleoncloud.org) (KVM@TACC)

```python
from chi import server, context

context.version = "1.0"
context.choose_project()
context.choose_site(default="KVM@TACC")

server.update_keypair()
```
### 1. Terraform for Provisioning

- Defined cloud resources in `.tf` files (`main.tf`, `provider.tf`, `variables.tf`)
- Set variables such as instance count, keypair, network, and image
- Used `terraform init`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform apply` to spin up 3 VM instances on Chameleon Cloud
- Outputted static private IPs and floating public IPs

#### Provisioning with Terraform

Terraform configuration files were organized under `tf/kvm/`. They defined:

- 3 compute instances on Chameleon Cloud (node1, node2, node3)
- Networking setup using `sharednet1` and private subnet `192.168.1.0/24`
- SSH key management
- Floating IP allocation for node1 (entry point)

**Deployment steps:**

```bash
cd tf/kvm
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
### 2. Ansible for Configuration

- Used Ansible playbooks to:
  - Install Kubernetes via **Kubespray**
  - Disable host firewalls and configure Docker
  - Set up networking, RBAC, and Helm

- Configured Ansible inventory with the provisioned IPs
- Verified node connectivity using Ansible‚Äôs ping module
- Executed playbooks like `pre_k8s_configure.yml`, `kubespray/cluster.yml`, and `post_k8s_configure.yml`

Ansible automation was organized in `ansible/` with subdirectories:

- `pre_k8s/`, `k8s/`, `post_k8s/` for system configuration and Kubernetes installation
- `argocd/` for managing **ArgoCD** apps and workflow orchestration

**Steps:**

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml pre_k8s/pre_k8s_configure.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml k8s/kubespray/cluster.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml post_k8s/post_k8s_configure.yml
```
This fully bootstrapped a self-managed Kubernetes cluster with:

- `kube-apiserver` on node1
- `CoreDNS`, `kubelet`, and container runtime on all nodes

---

### 3. Platform Services with **ArgoCD + Helm**

- Used `argocd_add_platform.yml` to deploy **MLflow**, **MinIO**, and Postgres via Helm
- Injected runtime IP addresses (`externalIPs`) dynamically using Ansible facts
- Created secure secrets (**MinIO** access key and secret key) dynamically
- Confirmed deployment via the **ArgoCD** dashboard and service endpoints

Platform services were deployed using Helm charts located under `k8s/platform/`. These included:

- **MLflow** (`mlflow.yaml`)
- **MinIO** (`minio.yaml`)
- **PostgreSQL** (backend for **MLflow**)
- Kubernetes namespace definitions (`namespace.yaml`)
- Parameterized via `values.yaml`

Deployment was triggered via:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml argocd/argocd_add_platform.yml
```
The `argocd_add_platform.yml` playbook:

- Logged into **ArgoCD** via port-forwarding
- Dynamically detected the public external IP of node1
- Set up secrets for **MinIO** access
- Registered the Helm chart and set **externalIP** values via `--helm-set-string`

### Outcomes and System **Behavior** -

- Fully operational 3-node K8s cluster running on Chameleon Cloud
- **MLflow** accessible via [http://129.114.26.118:8000](http://129.114.26.118:8000)
- **MinIO** via [http://129.114.26.118:9001](http://129.114.26.118:9001)
- **IaC** templates and playbooks stored in version control for repeatable deployment

---

### 4. Argo Workflows: Continuous Training and Image Build

Workflow templates were defined in `workflows/`:

- `train-model.yml`: triggers model training via HTTP
- `build-container-image.yml`: clones repo, pulls model from **MLflow**, builds Docker image with **Kaniko**
- `deploy-container-image.yml`: deploys image to a specific environment
- `promote-model.yml`: uses **Skopeo** to retag and promote models

Workflow execution was triggered with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml argocd/workflow_build_init.yml
```
This used the `build-initial.yml` template to:

- Clone the model repo from GitHub  
- Copy the latest model version into the image  
- Build and push version-tagged images (**staging-1.0.0**, **canary-1.0.0**, etc.)

### 5. Multi-Environment Deployment (Staging ‚Üí Canary ‚Üí Production)

Each deployment stage was configured using its own Helm chart under:

```bash
k8s/staging/
k8s/canary/
k8s/production/
```

Each contains:

- `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml` 
- `templates/lstm-app.yaml`

Deployment commands:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml argocd/argocd_add_staging.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml argocd/argocd_add_canary.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml argocd/argocd_add_prod.yml
```

### Observations and Outcomes

| **Area**                | **Outcome**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IaC Provisioning**     | Cluster created in ~3 minutes via **Terraform**                              |
| **System Configuration** | Zero manual SSH config; fully automated with **Ansible**                     |
| **Platform Services**    | **MLflow** + **MinIO** accessible at floating IP; secrets securely injected  |
| **Model Training**       | LSTM models trained and logged to **MLflow**, with version metadata          |
| **Container Build**      | **Kaniko** used to build model-serving image inside cluster                  |
| **Argo Workflows**       | Chained workflows allowed model ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy in one click                |
| **Deployment**           | Images deployed and promoted using **Helm** + **ArgoCD** with version tags   |

- All model lifecycles are now tracked and repeatable  
- No manual image builds or k8s edits needed post-push  
- Training + deployment can now be triggered via a single UI workflow in **Argo**
